## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- variablefont

### What I learned

  - variablefont (how to add a new font style to css using @font-face) 
  - various properties of using Flexbox for a box container
      - alignment of elements (justify-content, align-items, etc)
      - border styles, shadow styles
  - how to incorporate svg graphics in HTML

### Continued development

  - explore more properties of Flexbox
  - be more familiar with adding and using new font styles
  - utilize more semantic HTML markups, be familiar with <header> <main> <section> tags


### Useful resources

- [a great introduction about Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for understanding and implementing the basic properties of Flexbox. I really liked the detailed explanation and the examples.

## Acknowledgments

chatGpt has given me lots of guidance throughout the project, from planning out the project, to giving me detailed explanations about how to set certain properties of Flexbox to achieve a specific design. I feel like I have a very patient mentor working with me on this project.
